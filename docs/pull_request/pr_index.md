# Make a Pull Request

When making a contribution to this project, you'll want to open a [pull request](https://github.com/worldbank/gld/pulls).
This is a way to let the maintainers know that you have made a change and would like it to be reviewed and merged into the project.
Refer to the [branch management documentation](branch-management) for more information on how the project repository is organized.

We recommend that you first open an [issue](https://github.com/worldbank/gld/issues) to discuss the change you would like to make with project maintainers before creating a new feature and opening a pull request.
