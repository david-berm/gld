# How does the harmonization process work? What are the steps?

The harmonization process involves several key steps to ensure that data collected from various sources is standardized and ready for analysis. The first step in the harmonization process is to acquire the necessary data. This data can be obtained through downloading from official sources or it may be shared by colleagues. However, it is imperative to assess the data rights and ensure compliance with any relevant regulations or agreements.
Once the data is obtained, the next step is to organize it effectively. Survey folders are created, and documentation is stored in the correct folders to maintain clarity and accessibility. If additional documentation is required, efforts are made to acquire it promptly.

With the data organized, the harmonization process begins. Careful attention is paid to the existing results as the process unfolds. Evaluation is continuous, with a particular focus on ensuring that external parties, such as colleagues or NSO (National Statistical Office) staff, are consulted as needed. Sufficient time is allotted for their input, allowing for thorough collaboration while balancing other tasks.
Validation is the next stage in the harmonization process. Beyond internal validation with colleagues, external staff with domain knowledge, such as experts in education, are consulted. Additionally, all GLD quality checks are conducted, and the data is compared with relevant reports. Internal discussions further refine the validation process.

Once the data has been validated, Country Survey Details are documented. This documentation reflects all the knowledge acquired during the harmonization process, ensuring transparency and accuracy. Finally, the harmonized data is published to the GLD server and GitHub repository for wider access. If the data is designated for "official use," it is added to the GLD-Public server.
