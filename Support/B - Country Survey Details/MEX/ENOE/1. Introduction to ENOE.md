## What is the MEX ENOE?

The Mexican Labour Force and Unemployment Survey (ENOE) is the Mexican Labour Force Survey run as part of Mexico’s National Surveys series from 2005 to 2020.

## What does the MEX ENOE cover?

The Mexican ENOE is a labour force survey collecting information on demographic details (age, sex, location), education (academic), social security, labour market activities over the past quarter, as well as time use and activities over the previous 7 days. The years and sample size of ENOE harmonized for GLD are:

| Year | # of Households (HHID)  | # of Individuals (PID) |
|------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| 2005 | 126,481                 | 564,058                |

| 2020 | 132,788                 | 519,183                |

## Where can the data be found?

The microdata is free and publicly available on the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI). INEGI created a [dedicated website](https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/enoe/15ymas/#Microdatos) that records ENOE and all previous versions, besides it contains complete information to understand the framework of the ENOE. Data from 2019 onwards can only be circulated within the World Bank. For further information kindly get in touch with the World Bank Jobs Group.

## What is the sampling procedure?

The ENOE uses a stratified two-stage design. The introductory section of ENOE provides ample detail on the breakdown and goals of the process. Below we share a sequence of images that will allow the user to access the information in the ENOE webpage. The text is in Spanish. Yet, we did a short summary in English at the bottom of this section to give the user a general idea of the information.

[Summarized Translation from the original version]

    The sampling is probabilistic, two-stage, stratified by conglomerates.

    Observation unit: The House.
    Sampling unit: The private home.
    Analysis unit: The home and the residents of the dwelling. [...]

    Sampling frame : The sampling frame used for the ENOE is INEGI's 2012 National Housing Framework, built from the cartographic and demographic information obtained during the 2010 Population and Housing Census, which is updated with each new census survey. [...]

## What is the geographic significance level?

The results are at national, state, and *cities of interest* levels as well as for certain size categories of localities. The cities of interest and sizes of cities, however, may vary over time. It is thus important to check the individual methodology reports. The information on the 2019 ENOE can be found under section 3.3 (page 39/40) of [that year's report](https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/biblioteca/ficha.html?upc=702825190613).

## Other Noteworthy Aspects

### Change in the name of Mexico's capitals

Variable `subnatid1` defines the first administrative unit, which are the states in Mexico's case. Mexico's capital, technically not a state (the precise discussion is omitted here), has throughout the dataset a distinct code, namely code 9.

However, in [2016 the name changed officially](https://dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5424565&fecha=05/02/2016) from "Distrito Federal" to "Ciudad de México". As such the `subnatid1` variable changed from "9 - Distrito Federal" (code up to and including 2015) to "9 - Ciudad de México" (from 2016 on). This is also covered by the variable `subnatid1_prev` in 2016.

### Evolution of the ENOE questionnaires

In the past fifteen years, the Mexican national statistics institute
(INEGI) published five updates (Table 1) of the labor force questionnaire or
ENOE. The ENOE has two versions: the extended version and the basic
version. Every quarter, the INEGI conducts labor surveys using either
version.

### Information used in the GLD harmonization

Since ENOE reports quarterly results using different questionnaires, the
harmonization team choose to append quarterly results. 

Annualizing data means that the results from extended and basic version
questionnaires would merge which may cause lose of information. In table 2.
the team summarized the list of absent GLD variables in the basic questionnaire version and available at Extended version.

Table 2. Inconsistent GLD variables in the annualized ENOE

| GLD variable | Extended version variable|
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `socialsec` | `p3m4`:  Option 4 retirement fund (SAR or Afore)?|
| `healthins` | `p3m5`: Option 5 life insurance?|
| `firmsize_l_2` and `firmsize_u_2` | `p7e`: Approximately how many people work where you work ... in your second job?|
| `union` | `p3i`: In your job ... Do you belong to a union?|


### Months outside quarters

Some interviews were conducted outside the quarter corresponding to their respective months. We are uncertain about the reasons for this occurrence. Below is a Stata code snippet to identify such observations, followed by a table showing the proportion relative to the sample.

```
* If inside_q == 0 then, the interview was conducted in a month that does not correspond to the respective quarter 
gen  inside_q = 0
replace inside_q = 1 if inrange(int_month,1,3) & wave == "Q1"
replace inside_q = 1 if inrange(int_month,4,6) & wave == "Q2"
replace inside_q = 1 if inrange(int_month,7,9) & wave == "Q3"
replace inside_q = 1 if inrange(int_month,10,12) & wave == "Q4"
```

### Adjustments during the covid-19 pandemic

Although for the year 2020 the harmonized dataset contains information for the entire year, it is important to note that there are some differences in the data between quarters.

INEGI made exceptional decisions regarding ENOE during the period of social distancing to contain the spread of COVID-19 among the Mexican population. Below is a brief summary of these measures:

2020-Q1: 

  - The ENOE survey was conducted as it had been in previous years.
  
2020-Q2: 

  - ETOE survey (Encuesta Telefónica de Ocupación y Empleo).  
  - It presents the same conceptual design as ETOE; however, all interviews were conducted by phone using a sub sample of individuals from ETOE 2020-Q1 who had phone contact (approximately 10%). Throughout the quarter. All households were followed up on a monthly basis.
  - In June, face-to-face interviews were added, which were achieved gradually as data collection activities resumed for the sample from the June ENOE survey.
  
2020-Q3 and Q4: 

  - ETOE survey (Encuesta Nacional de Ocupación y Empleo. Nueva Edición).  
  - It maintains the same conceptual, statistical, and methodological design as the traditional ENOE, but incorporates a hybrid operational strategy and sample that includes both face-to-face and telephone interviews.
  - Households with telephone interviews were followed up monthly, while the face-to-face interviews were conducted quarterly.
  
For more information please check [ETOE](https://en.www.inegi.org.mx/investigacion/etoe/) and [ENOEN](https://en.www.inegi.org.mx/contenidos/programas/enoe/15ymas/doc/enoe_n_diseno_conceptual.pdf).
  
The table below, shows a summary of the ENOE data collection on the year 2020.

| quarter | interview type           | Frequency          |
|---------|:--------------------------:|:--------------------:|
| Q1      | face to face             | quarterly          |
| Q2      | phone                    | monthly            |
| Q3      | face to face, phone      | quarterly, monthly |
| Q4      | face to face, phone      | quarterly, monthly |



### Coding of industry and occupation codes

The ENOE codes occupation based on the "Mexican Classification of Occupations" (Clasificación Mexicana de Ocupaciones - CMO) from 2005 to 2012 and from 2013 to 2020 on the "National System of Classification of Occupations" (Sistema Nacional de Clasificación de Ocupaciones - SINCO). These are mapped to ISCO-08.

On the industry side, ENOE codifies industry over the years based on four different versions of the North American System of Industrial Classification (Sistema de Clasificación Industrial de América del Norte - SCIAN), namely the 2007 versions, all data is mapped to ISIC-4.

The table below provides an overview of the different versions underlying the survey as well as what version they have been mapped to. The precise details of how the mapping was done is covered [here in a separate document on occupations](Correspondence_occup_ISCO.md) as well as [here on industry classification](Correspondence_NAICS_ISIC.md).


| Year of survey	| National occup version	| ISCO version	| National industry version	| ISIC version	|
