## What is the MEX ENOE?

The Mexican Labour Force and Unemployment Survey (ENOE) is the Mexican Labour Force Survey run as part of Mexico’s National Surveys series from 2005 to 2020.

## What does the MEX ENOE cover?

The Mexican ENOE is a labour force survey collecting information on demographic details (age, sex, location), education (academic), social security, labour market activities over the past quarter, as well as time use and activities over the previous 7 days. The years and sample size of ENOE harmonized for GLD are:

| Year	    | # of Individuals | # of Households	|
| :-------	| :--------	       | :--------	 	|
| 2005      |    1,649,291     | 126,481
| 2006      |    1,663,902     | 127,784
| 2007      |    1,643,644     | 127,562
| 2008      |    1,619,352     | 126,713
| 2009      |    1,590,077     | 125,773
| 2010      |    1,593,114     | 126,092
| 2011      |    1,574,013     | 125,882
| 2012      |    1,563,171     | 125,780
| 2013      |    1,552,325     | 179,943
| 2014      |    1,590,748     | 126,799
| 2015      |    1,579,514     | 126,985
| 2016      |    1,548,185     | 127,381
| 2017      |    1,543,995     | 129,937
| 2018      |    1,535,217     | 129,158
| 2019      |    1,590,785     | 134,522
| 2020      |    1,142,227     | 132,788

Note that the ENOE is a panel survey where households are visited up to five times, explaining the low number of households for the sample size.

## Where can the data be found?

The microdata is free and publicly available on the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI). INEGI created a [dedicated website](https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/enoe/15ymas/#Microdatos) that records ENOE and all previous versions, besides it contains complete information to understand the framework of the ENOE. Data from 2019 onwards can only be circulated within the World Bank. For further information kindly get in touch with the World Bank Jobs Group.

## What is the sampling procedure?

The ENOE uses a stratified two-stage design. The introductory section of ENOE provides ample detail on the breakdown and goals of the process. Below we share a sequence of images that will allow the user to access the information in the ENOE webpage. The text is in Spanish. Yet, we did a short summary in english at the bottom of this section to give the user a general idea of the information.

[Summarized Translation from the original version]

    The sampling is probabilistic, two-stage, stratified by conglomerates.

    Observation unit: The House.
    Sampling unit: The private home.
    Analysis unit: The home and the residents of the dwelling. [...]

    Sampling frame : The sampling frame used for the ENOE is INEGI's 2012 National Housing Framework, built from the cartographic and demographic information obtained during the 2010 Population and Housing Census, which is updated with each new census survey. [...]

## What is the geographic significance level?

The results are at national, state, and *cities of interest* levels as well as for certain size categories of localities. The cities of interest and sizes of cities, however, may vary over time. It is thus important to check the individual methodology reports. The information on the 2019 ENOE can be found under section 3.3 (page 39/40) of [that year's report](https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/biblioteca/ficha.html?upc=702825190613).

## Other Noteworthy Aspects

### Change in the name of Mexico's capitals

Variable `subnatid1` defines the first administrative unit, which are the states in Mexico's case. Mexico's capital, technically not a state (the precise discussion is omitted here), has throughout the dataset a distinct code, namely code 9.

However, in [2016 the name changed officially](https://dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5424565&fecha=05/02/2016) from "Distrito Federal" to "Ciudad de México". As such the `subnatid1` variable changed from "9 - Distrito Federal" (code up to and including 2015) to "9 - Ciudad de México" (from 2016 on). This is also covered by the variable `subnatid1_prev` in 2016.

### Evolution of the ENOE questionnaires

In the past fifteen years, the Mexican national statistics institute
(INEGI) published five updates (Table 1) of the labor force questionnaire or
ENOE. The ENOE has two versions: the extended version and the basic
version. Every quarter, the INEGI conducts labor surveys using either
version.

### Effect of the CoVid Pandemic

The CoVid 19 Pandemic interrupted regular surveys procedure. The data for 2020 was only collected as expected in the first quarter of 2020. Data thereafter must be used with precaution.

From the third trimester of 2020 to the fourth trimester of 2022 INEGI operated a different survey (called ENOE_N) that contained a smaller sample size and a larger reliance on phone interviews. 

The data is available on the INEGI website but is not used in GLD. From the first trimester of 2023 the ENOE continued (largely) as before.

### Coding of industry and occupation codes

The ENOE codes occupation based on the "Mexican Classification of Occupations" (Clasificación Mexicana de Ocupaciones - CMO) from 2005 to 2012 and from 2013 to 2020 on the "National System of Classification of Occupations" (Sistema Nacional de Clasificación de Ocupaciones - SINCO). These are mapped to ISCO-08.

On the industry side, ENOE codifies industry over the years based on four different versions of the North American System of Industrial Classification (Sistema de Clasificación Industrial de América del Norte - SCIAN), namely the 2007 versions, all data is mapped to ISIC-4.

The table below provides an overview of the different versions underlying the survey as well as what version they have been mapped to. The precise details of how the mapping was done is covered [here in a separate document on occupations](Correspondence_occup_ISCO.md) as well as [here on industry classification](Correspondence_NAICS_ISIC.md).


| Year of survey	| National occup version	| ISCO version	| National industry version	| ISIC version	|

### Relevant information from INEGI on the ISIC codes used by ENOE

Please check the following [document](https://github.com/worldbank/gld/blob/1ff9697fbfe571a1b95c6d10c4f8ce5e0d6a7568/Support/B%20-%20Country%20Survey%20Details/MEX/ENOE/utilities/Comentario%20aplicado%20a%20la%20versi%C3%B3n%202(spa-eng).pdf) to get more insight on the ENOE SCIAN codes and the meaning of the digits used in the raw data.
