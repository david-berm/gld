## What is the LKA LFS?

The Sri Lankan Labor Force Survey (LFS) is a household-based sample survey conducted by the Department of Census & Statistics under the National Household Survey Program. Starting in 1990, the LKA LFS has been conducted quarterly every year with the aim to measure the levels and trends of employment, unemployment and labor force in Sri Lanka. 


## What does the LKA LFS cover?

The LKA LFS mainly covers detailed information on demographic details, including age, sex, marital status, and location, education, and labour market activities. Economic activities such as employment status, work hours and payment were collected in two reference periods: 1) "current" or "last-7-day" activities and 2) "usual" status or the "past 12-month" reference period. The LKA LFS does not have a specific migration section, though it has a question about birth place. Yet it cannot be sufficiently deemed as a an indication of migration.   

Years and sample size of LFS harmonized for GLD are:

## Where can the data be found?



## What is the sampling procedure?

The sampling procedure of LKA LFS is a stratified two-stage probability sample design, The primary sampling units (PSU) are census blocks; and the secondary sampling units are the housing units. Although the number of PSU selected per quarter varies through years (i.e. 252 PSUs per quarter in 1992 whereas 2,250 in 2007) depending on the Census of Population and Housing in past years, the survey usually select 10 housing units per PSU per quarter. 

Since LKA LFS is a quarterly survey, it was conducted every three months and would take two months to conduct interview and collect data. So most of the years, except those without complete four quarters, have 8 categories of "month of interview" variable in the raw dataset: two months for each quarter and four quarters in total. Month 1 and 2 would be coded as `wave 1`, for example.

## What is the geographic significance level?

The LKA LFS is representative at the urban/rural division of each district level. 

Note that in the raw data the `sector` variable originally has three categories: urban, rural, and estate. An estate sector in Sri Lanka is actually a plantation sector. An estate sector consists of all plantations which are 20 acres or more
in extent and ten or more resident labourers. All areas other than urban and estate comprise the rural sector [(_Sinnathurai, V., Březinová, O., 2012_)](utilities/Sinnathurai_V_Březinová_O_2012.pdf). We classified estate as rural in our harmonization, considering the level of poverty, development, population and housing factors.  


## Other noteworthy aspects  

### Coding of industry and occupation codes




### Regional exclusion of Northern and Eastern Provinces

 
 

### Urban/Rural status






### Duplicates in early years and household heads re-assignment
