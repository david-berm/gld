# Urban panel data from the PLFS

The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) employs a two-stage sampling design to gather employment data across India. For urban areas, it utilizes a rotational panel scheme, while for rural regions, a cross-sectional survey approach is adopted. The urban panel data is visited for four consecutive quarters, and when combined with the single-visit cross-sectional data from rural areas, it facilitates users to generate nuanced labor estimates on a quarterly basis for each state, segmented by urban and rural demographics.

The PLFS adopts a strategic rotational design for its urban samples, ensuring consistent data capture throughout the year. The starting point in this rotational system is the P11 panel, designated as the "first" panel in the survey cycle. Representing 25% of the annual urban allocation, this panel sets the pace for the year-long survey, which spans four quarters. As each quarter unfolds, new panels are successively introduced, while the earlier ones, like the P11, are revisited. It's essential to highlight that the initial household listings remain unchanged during revisits, even if there are declinations in participation or a change in dwelling occupants.

In the PLFS structure, the dwelling serves as the primary unit of analysis, not its changing inhabitants. Original household IDs are steadfastly retained, even if there's a shift in the residents of a dwelling. This consistent identification is maintained across all panels, including the foundational P11. Once a panel completes its four-quarter survey cycle, it's succeeded by a new one in the subsequent year. By year's end, a 75% overlap exists between samples from two adjacent quarters, creating a synchronized survey environment. This approach ensures a harmonious progression of panels at different lifecycle stages, delivering a continuous and detailed labor data stream.
