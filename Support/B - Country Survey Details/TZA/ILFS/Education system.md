# Introduction

Tanzania's education system is complex. Education policy is decided autonomously for Mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar. An education reform in 2006 introduced changes in Zanzibar reducing primary education from 7 years to 6 years, but this has not been implemented until 2010. Mainland Tanzania followed suit and began implementation of a similar scheme in 2016. Along with these changes, and not to be confused with the similarity in numbers, the primary entry age is also reduced from 7 to 6. But before 2010, and for the longest time, both Zanzibar and Mainland Tanzania operate under the same scheme. As an implication, individuals in 2014 and 2020 rounds complete primary education at different year levels: the threshold for primary complete is Standard 7 pre-reform, and Standard 6 post-reform. 

This policy background raises the question on how "primary completed" should be coded in the GLD harmonization, particularly when the raw variable for educational attainment is detailed at the education year level. This is a concern specifically for the 2014 round where individuals in Zanzibar are a mix of the old and new scheme, and for 2020 round where the mix of the two schemes occur in both Zanzibar and Mainland Tanzania. Unfortunately, there is no variable indicating which individuals are on the old and new schemes in any of the ILFS rounds, so coding decisions need to rely on the theoretical age for the affected group to proxy for reform-affected individuals. 

The logic adopted here is to determine the potentially-affected age group in each of the rounds to determine whether the majority of the sample are potentially in the old or new scheme. For instance, if there were more people in the 2014 round beyond the potentially-affected age group, then the coding should use Standard 7; otherwise, it should use Standard 6. Bias will result in either way (i.e., Standard 7 as threshold will exert upward bias on primary incomplete, and Standard 6 on primary complete), but the objective of this process is to select the threshold that minimizes it. 

The first question in this process is how to determine the potentially-affected age group. Assuming that the reform kicks in immediately for the incoming Standard 6 cohort, theoretically 13 years old at that time (also consistent with the age cut-off in this UNICEF report), then in the Zanzibar 2014 round, these individuals should be 17 years old, which also becomes the upper bound for the potentially-affected age group. The lower bound is simply 13 years old, assuming that these children enter based on the pre-reform primary entry age of 7. In the 2020 round, the upper bound is raised to 23 years old (= 17 + 6) for Zanzibar and 17 years old for Mainland Tanzania. The lower bound is set at age 13 for Mainland Tanzania, and age 12 for Zanzibar since the change in primary entry age is likely to have taken into effect by then.
