# Merging Extra Data and Coding Labour Variables for 2017-2022

The extra data we received from the NSO includes all questions from Section A *Activity during the reference week, agricultural work and ,market orientation* and two income questions from Section B *Main Job*. In addition to the question-based variables, the data also contains IDm, quarter, and weight variables for uniquely identifying observations.  

Before harmonization, for each year, we merged the confidential labour data from NSO into the raw data downloaded from the NSO website using weight and ID variables. And then we used the assembled data sets for harmonization, whcih allows us to code `lstatus`, `potential_lf`, and `wage_no_compen` from the very original variabled pulled out directly from the survey instead of using the derived variables.
