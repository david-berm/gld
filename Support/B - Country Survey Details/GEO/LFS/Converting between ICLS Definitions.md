# Introduction
Since the passing of the [resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization](https://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm) in 2013 at the 19th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) surveys are at risk of a series break due to the change in the concept of employment.

In short, the ICLS 19 resolution restricts employment to *work performed for others in exchange for pay or profit*, meaning that own consumption work (e.g., subsistence agriculture or building housing for oneself) are not counted as employment.

The GLD codes the harmonizationâ€™s `lstatus` variable based on the concept used in the survey. In the case of the Georgian LFS this change occurs after 2019, when the survey switches to new definition. As a result, [time series data](utilities/GEO_lstatus.png) show a decrease in the size of employed and labor force participants for the 2020-2022 round. However, the code can be altered to try to match the previous definition. And this operation can be done conveniently taking advantage of the questionnaire's structure. 

# Framework for identifying the employed in the 2020-2022 GEO LFS

The information on current activity were used to define the employed using Questions A1-A9 in the questionnaire. The general flow of section A involves first asking the individual if he/she engaged in any activity to produce agricultural or fishery products in the past 7 days, for pay or for own use/consumption, if no agricultural activities then any non-agricultural activities, and lastly if no activities engaged what was the reason; if the individual reports otherwise, he/she would be asked about information regarding temporary absence from employment. 


# Current coding for the GEO LFS

In 2017-2019, the respondents who indicate that they either worked for salary (A1 is Yes) or engaged in activities for own consumption (A2 is Yes) are employed (B1 is only for employed respondents - see image below).

In 2020-2022, two separate questions (A1.5 and A1.6 - see image below) were added to confirm whether the production from the respondent's main activity (from A1) was for profit or for own use. These two questions allow users to change `lstatus` between the old and the new definitions by adding observations who chose category 3 or category 4 in question A1.5 and A1.6 (underlined red below).

![2020_questionnaire1](utilities/2020_icls_1.png)
![2020_questionnaire2](utilities/2020_icls_2.png)

The current coding for 2020-2022 is straightforward:

```
replace lstatus=1 if inlist(A1_5,1,2)|inlist(A1_6,1,2)|A2==1|A3==1|A4==1|inrange(A6,6,9)|A7==1|A8==1|A9==1
```

in which all observations whose answers lead them to section B, "Main Job", were coded as employed, namely category 1 to all the variables in the code block above. 

Even though this line of code restricts production for own consumption by restricting answers to `A1_5` and `A1_6`, the questionnaire's structure still allows for dual employment. For example, following the logic of the questions shown in the screenshot below, observations who worked for domestic production mainly for own consumption (`A1_5==3`), worked for non-zero days and hours in the last 7 days (`!missing(A1_7)&!missing(A1_8)`), answered A1.9 and also worked for at least one hour in order to get paid (`A2==1`) were employed according to our code.  

![2020_questionnaire3](utilities/2020_questionnaire_B_module.png)

Therefore, the code below follows the previous line of code to make sure for-own-production workers entering question A2 and moving forward will not be coded as employed.  
```
replace lstatus=. if lstatus==1&[inlist(A1_5,3,4)|inlist(A1_6,3,4)]&[A5==2|A6==12|A7==2|A9==2]
```

But this line of code only excludes observations who worked for own consumption and did not work for pay at all. It fulfilled that purpose by replacing observations with missing values if they were mistakenly coded as employed but their answers to A5, A6, A7 and A9 lead them to section F, "Previous Work Experience". The GLD harmonization did not further differentiate between main job and side job for dual employment workers. We followed the National Statistics Office's definition and classified them as employed.

Nonetheless, the information of time spent on own-consumption production in terms of days (A1.7) and hours (A1.8) allows users flexibility to make their own rules and decide how they want to define dual employment workers based on their time spent on own-consumption production.

# Coding to convert the 2020 ILFS to the old definition

In converting back to the old definition, the approach adopted here is simply to remove all the restrictions on `A1_5` and `A1_6`, and instead, to code respondents who have answered question A1.5 to A1.9 as employed regardless of their answers to question A2 and questions forward. The revised codes would be:

```
* Generate empty variable first
gen lstatus_old_iscls = .

* Code employed as per ICLS-19 (only for market exchange)
replace lstatus_old_icls = 1 if inlist(A1_5,1,2) | inlist(A1_6,1,2) | A2==1 | A3==1 | A4==1 | inrange(A6,6,9) | A7==1 | A8==1 | A9==1

* Add those left out but covered by ICLS-13
replace lstatus_old_icls = 1 if (inrange(A1_5,3,4) | inrange(A1_6,3,4)) & mi(lstatus_old_icls)
```

Note that the above only covers the employment status. These added workers should also have information on their occupation sector, employment sector, industry, occupation, ... Own consumption workers are by definition self-employed and in the private sector. Regarding their industry and occupation, question A1.9 directly provides their industrial classification codes in NACE rev.2. And in 2020-2022, own-consumption workers' industry ranges from NACE rev.2 111 to 322, which are all in "Agriculture". As for occupation, users could refer to for-salary workers' occupations with the same industry codes. The data shows that own-consumption workers' industrial codes are mostly in "Elementary Occupations".
