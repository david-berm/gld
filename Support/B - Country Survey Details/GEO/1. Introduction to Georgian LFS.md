## What is the GEO LFS?

The Georgian Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a household-based sample survey conducted by the Central Statistical Agency (CSA). This survey was first undertaken in 1999 followed by LFS 2005 as the second one in the LFS series. Till the birth of LFS 1999, there has not been a comprehensive national labor force survey representing both urban and rural area in Ethiopia. Both the 1981/82 and 1987/88 surveys only covered the rural part of the country. Therefore, the LFS came out to cover both the urban and rural areas of 12 regions in Georgia to fill the vacancy of national statistics.

Between 1998 and 2016, the labour force indicators were from another survey, Integrated Household Survey (IHS). The labour force module was seperated from the IHS and became an independent survey in 2017. During 1998-2016, IHS maintained a sample size of 3,400 households whereas LFS maintained sample size of about 6,400 households per quarter since 2017.


## What does the GEO LFS cover?

The GEO LFS mainly covers detailed information on demographic details, including age, sex, marital status, and location, education, and labour market activities over the previous 7 days for all private household members aged 15 and above. Years used for harmonization range from 2017 to 2022 continuously, 6 years in total.

Years and sample size of LFS harmonized for GLD are:

| **Year**	| **# of Households**	| **# of Individuals**	| **Expanded Population**	|
| :------:	| :-------:		| :-------:	 	| :-------:	 	|
| [2017](utilities/report/GEO_2017_report.pdf) | 20,486         |  54,824     |  12,049,182  | 
| [2018](utilities/report/GEO_2018_report.pdf) | 20,347         |  58,636     |  12,136,511  |
| [2019](utilities/report/GEO_2019_report.pdf) | 21,501         |  61,386     |  12,148,502  |
| [2020](utilities/report/GEO_2020_report.pdf) | 20,697         |  58,979     |  12,074,070  |
| [2021](utilities/report/GEO_2021_report.pdf) | 21,367         |  60,837     |  12,041,059  | 
| [2022](utilities/report/GEO_2022_report.pdf) | 21,366         |  60,262     |  11,955,709  | 

All the six years' official annual reports are provided in the table above through the links attached to each year. Each year's annual report mainly covers employment and unemployed rates as well as their changes compared to the previous year.    

## Where can the data be found?

Data from 2017 to 2022 are publicly available on the [Georgia National Statistics Office website](https://www.geostat.ge/en/modules/categories/130/labour-force-survey-databases). 

## What is the sampling procedure?

The GEO LFS uses a stratified random sampling design with 12 regions being the primary sampling unit, and households as the secondary sampling unit. For all six years, GEO LFS are representative at urban/rural parts of region level. 

Following the technical guidance from the World Bank and other international organizations, the GEO LFS revisits a certain proportion of households to build the LFS into panel data. Between 1998 and 2016, each sampled household was interviewed four times (or once a quarter) during the given year. After this period, the household was replaced by another household, or a new residence. In each month, the newly added households account for one-twelfth of the total sample.

But since 2017, the CSA adopted a new "two-two-two" rotation scheme which interviewed a sampled household in two consecutive quarters, then excluded this household for the next two quarters, and re-visited the household for the same two quarters of the next year. In this way, the newly added households account for one-fourth of the total sample size per quarter. However, the indicator of visiting record is not included in the raw data sets. Without the variable of visit, we are not able to uniquely identify households throughout time, and hence are not able to establish the panel data. An overall introduction and basic information of GEO LFS are covered in this [offical document](utilities/GEO_intro.pdf).

## What is the geographic significance level?

The GEO LFS is representative at the regional level with rural/urban division.

## Other noteworthy aspects  

### Coding of industry and occupation codes

Regarding industrial classification, the first three years, 2017-2019, used the Statistical classification of Economic Activities in the European Community (NACE) rev.1 as the national classification, which corresponds to International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) rev.3. The last three years, 2020-2022, used more recent versions of national and international classifications, NACE rev.2 vs. ISIC rev.4. 

For the classification of occupation, all six years followed the International Standard Classification of Occupation (ISCO) and did not have a separate national classification. 2017 to 2019 used ISCO 1998 whereas 2020 to 2022 used ISCO 2008.  

Refer to this [separate document](Correspondence_National_International_Classifications.md) for detailed correspondence table of industrial classification and coding scheme in GLD. 

### Observation Exclusion

Each year's raw data set used for GLD harmonization was assembled manually as the original survey data were divided by sections, such as demographic section and main economic activities section. During the assembling process, each year has a certain amount of observations with only demographic information but no appearance in the economic activities section. Although there is no explicit explanation for the exclusion of these observations, the most likely reason, according to the [offical document](utilities/GEO_intro.pdf), is that these observations satisfy any of the following conditions:

Below are the statistics of excluded observations in each year.  

| **Year**	| **# Excluded**	| **# Included**	| **% Excluded**	|
| :------:	| :-------:		| :-------:	 	| :-------:	 	|
| 2017 | 18,604         |  54,824     | 25.34  | 
| 2018 | 16,055         |  58,636     | 21.50  |
| 2019 | 15,619         |  61,386     | 20.28  |
| 2020 | 13,699         |  58,979     | 18.85  |
| 2021 | 14,987         |  60,837     | 19.77  | 
| 2022 | 15,264         |  60,262     | 20.21  |

### Change of the Employment Standard

2017 to 2019 follow the 13th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) whereas 2020 to 2022 follow the ICLS 19. This change is shown in the employment section in the questionnaire.

In 2017-2019, the respondents who indicate that they either worked for salary (A1 is Yes) or engaged in activities for own consumption (A2 is Yes) are employed (B1 is only for employed respondents).

In 2020-2022, a separate question (A1.5) was added to confirm whether the production from your main activity (from A1) was for profit or for own use.
