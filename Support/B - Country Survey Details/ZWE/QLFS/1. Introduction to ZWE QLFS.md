## What is the ZWE QLFS survey?

The Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (ZIMSTAT) started conducting Quarterly Labour Force Surveys (QLFS) in the 3rd quarter of 2021 to ensure timely reporting of labour statistics.

## What does the ZWE QLFS survey cover?

The Q3 2021 QLFS is the first of its kind. It follows the 2013 labour force framework adopted at the 19th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) that provided new guidelines for measuring and compiling statistics on work, employment, and labour underutilization.

The ZWE LFS is nationally representative. The sampling frame used for the LFCLS was the Zimbabwe Master Sample developed by the then Central Statistical Office after the 2002 Population Census. Except for Harare and Bulawayo, each of the other eight provinces was stratified into four strata according to land use: Communal Lands, Large Scale Commercial Farming Areas (LSCFA), Urban and Semi-Urban Areas, and Small-Scale Commercial Farming Areas (SSCFA) and Resettlement Areas. Only one urban stratum was formed each in Harare and Bulawayo, giving 34 strata in total.

| Year   | # of Households        | # of Individuals|
| :------- | :--------                             | :--------             |
| 2021 (Q3)       | N/A    | 46,085 |
| 2021 (Q4)       | N/A    | 44,163 |
| 2022 (Q1)       | N/A    | 44,442 |
| 2022 (Q2)       | N/A    | 43,362|
| 2022 (Q3)       | N/A    | 42,074 |

## Where can the data be found?
The microdata from the Quarterly LFS is available through the Zimbabwe Statistics [Website](https://www.zimstat.co.zw/labour-force-publications/). A quarterly report is available.

## What is the sampling procedure?
The sampling procedure is a two-stage sample design. The 1st stage was the selection of enumeration areas using the probability proportional to size criteria. The 2nd stage was the selection of households in the selected enumeration areas using a random systematic sampling technique. 500 enumeration areas in total and 12,500 households were selected for the survey. 

## What is the geographic significance level?
The primary objectives are to provide information on the number of people classified according to their activity status, the size, and characteristics of the economically active population, that is, the employed and the unemployed, the informal sector employment and informal employment, retrenchments, the number of working children, the detrimental effects of work on children, and the living conditions in general. Also, information by gender and urban location is available.

## Other Noteworthy Aspects

- In 2021 Q3 and Q4, some responses from participants were recorded in the data and the questionnaire questions are misaligned. In particular, the user of the raw data should note that Q8, Q9 and Q10 questions and answer labels are different to the questionnaire.
- In 2021 Q3 and Q4 the values of employment status differ between quarters for the category of "contributing family workers". 
- Household IDs (HHID) cannot be created for any quarter because the raw data does not contain identificators. The data is only identifiable randomly at the household level.
