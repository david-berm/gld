# Tunisia's education system

Tunisia's education system begins with non-compulsory pre-primary education, leading into nine years of mandatory basic education starting at age 6. This segment is divided into six years of primary education followed by three years of lower secondary education. After this foundational stage, students progress to secondary education, which is split into two main tracks: general/technical and vocational.

The general/technical secondary track extends over four years, culminating in the Baccalauréat exam, essential for higher education admission. The vocational track, meanwhile, offers specialized training tailored to the labor market, with programs varying in length and focus, designed to equip students with practical skills and qualifications.

For higher education, students can initially pursue a two-year program leading to the Diploma d’Etudes Universitaires du Premier Cycle, a preparatory degree. Those seeking further specialization may continue to a two-year program concluding with the Diplome d’Etudes Approfondies (DEA), which focuses on advanced study and research in their field and is a prerequisite for doctoral studies.
