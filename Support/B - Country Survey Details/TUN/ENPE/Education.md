# Tunisia's Education system 

## Primary and Secondary Education
Education in Tunisia is free and compulsory for children aged 6 to 16. The system is divided into two cycles within the École de Base: the Premier Cycle (Primary school) lasting 6 years, starting at age 6, without awarding any educational credential upon completion, and the Deuxième Cycle (Lower secondary school) spanning 3 years, after which students receive a Diplôme de Fin d'Études de l'Enseignement de Base.

Upon completion of lower secondary education, students may opt for vocational upper secondary education lasting 2 years, leading to a Certificate d'Aptitude Professionnelle (CAP). After the CAP, students can continue to a 2-year Brevet de Technicien Professionnelle (BTP) program.

Alternatively, students may choose the École secondaire (Academic upper secondary school), a 4-year program culminating in the Baccalauréat examination. Post-2nd year, students have the option to enter a BTP program instead of continuing with the academic track.

## Post-Secondary Education
Tunisia's post-secondary education system, restructured in 2006-07 to align with the French L-M-D system, demands a set number of Unites d'Enseignement (UE) or Teaching Units, similar to credits, for each level of university study.

### First Cycle (Academic and Vocational/Technical):

University first-level programs last 2 years, awarding a Diplôme National de Premier Cycle d'Études, often followed by the program of study name.
Vocational post-secondary programs range from 2 to 3 years. The Brevet de Technicien Supérieur (BTS) lasts 2 years, and both the Diplôme de Technicien Supérieur and Diplôme Universitaire de Technologie span 2-3 years, requiring a Baccalauréat for admission.

### Second Cycle:

This includes 2-year programs leading to a Maîtrise, 3-year engineering programs following a first cycle diploma leading to a Diplôme National d'Ingénieur, and 2-year graduate programs leading to either a Mastère Recherché or a Mastère Professionnel, depending on the field of study.

### Third Cycle:

Doctoral studies, following a Mastère Recherché, require at least 3 years of coursework and research, culminating in the defense of a dissertation to earn a Doctorat.
