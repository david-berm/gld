# Introduction to Tunisia (TUN LFS)

## What is the TUN LFS?

The Tunisia Enquête Nationale sur la Population et l’Emploi (ENPE), translated in English as the National Survey on Population and Employment, has been conducted by the Tunisia Institut National de la Statistique (INS) since 1997. The frequency of conducting the survey has changed over time. It started an biannual national survey in 1997, became an annual survey in 2000, then transitioned to a quarterly survey beginning the fourth quarter of 2011. 

## What does the TUN ENPE cover?
The Tunisia ENPE is a labor force survey with information on household roster characteristics, education, employment, primary and secondary economic activities in the past week, work history and characteristics of the unemployed and household living conditions. The harmonized years and sample sizes used in the GLD harmonization are as follows:

| year | persons | households |
|------|---------|------------|
| 1997 | 136659  | 26989      |
| 2000 | 128051  | 25870      |
| 2001 | 221585  | 46011      |
| 2005 | 288586  | 63443      |
| 2006 | 290685  | 64290      |
| 2007 | 628198  | 140799     |
| 2008 | 616531  | 140917     |
| 2009 | 660905  | 157756     |
| 2010 | 548456  | 137878     |
| 2011 Q2 | 163683  | 40102      |
| 2012 Q2 | 497063  | 123802     |
| 2013 Q2 | 472244  | 120341     |
| 2015 Q2 | 486668  | 125891     |
| 2016 Q2 | 478601  | 126287     |
| 2017 Q2 | 452928  | 121217     |

## Where can the data be found?
The datasets can be downloaded publicly in the [African Development Bank (AfDB) microdata library](https://microdata-catalog.afdb.org/index.php/home). Users need to note the following when using these datasets:
-	These variables in these datasets are only a subset of the complete list of possible variables based on the questionnaire. Data on wages were not provided, and key employment information were only available with some variables vary in terms of level of detail over time.
-	A more comprehensive data is available for 2010 but still lacked data on wages
-	Data for 2011 onwards are only available for the second quarter. 

## What is the sampling procedure?
The Tunisia LFS uses a two-stage sampling design. The first step involves drawing districts with probability proportional to size based on the General Population and Housing Census from a pool of districts stratified by governorates and areas.  The second step involves randomly drawing a cluster containing an average between 15 and 35 households per district. 

## What is the significance level?

The significance level of the survey varies over time. In 2005 and 2006, the survey is significant at the regional level. Beginning 2007 onwards, the data is significant at the governorate (or state) level, made possible by the increased sample size throughout this period, with the exception of the 2011 survey where the data is significant only at the regional level. We do not have reports between 1997 and 2000, so we cannot determine the significant level of disaggregation. Because of the much lower sample size and to take a conservative stance, we suggest that the estimates are significant at the national level.

## Other noteworthy aspects

### Geographic Information

Tunisia is  divided into 24 governorates or provinces grouped into seven geographical regions, which are not formal administrative divisions but are commonly used to describe different parts of the country. The governorates are further subdivided into districts, but the survey does not provide information at this level of detail. 

| subnatid1        | subnatid2                               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1 - Central Tunis | Tunis, Ariana, Ben Arous, Manouba      |
| 2 - North East    | Nabeul, Zaghouan, Bizerte              |
| 3 - North West    | Beja, Jendouba, Le Kef, Siliana        |
| 4 - Central East  | Sousse, Monastir, Mahdia, Sfax         |
| 5 - Central West  | Kairouan, Kasserine, Sidi Bouzide      |
| 6 - South East    | Gabes, Mednine, Tataouine              |
| 7 - South West    | Gafsa, Tozeur, Kebili                  |

In 2000, the governorate of Manouba was created after splitting from the governorate of Ariana. This change is immediately reflected in the 2001 survey. 

### Defining the labor force in the earlier surveys
In its earlier years, particularly between 1997 and 2001, the Tunisia INS used a different definition to identify the labor force population. The precise details are covered in a separate document [here](Defining%20the%20Labor%20Force.md)

### Household ID
The datasets received contain ID information. In the GLD project, we have created IDs to provide the best user experience based on geographic identifiers. The household ID is formed based on information on the governorate or region, and the household identifier. There are special cases where we adopted a different approach to construct the IDs because the governorate/region, household ID and individual ID do not uniquely identify the individual respondents.

•	**In 2010**, the individual ID is re-used multiple times for the same household, we re-create the individual ID by sorting the household members by age and sex. 

•	**In 2007, 2008, 2009**, combining governorates and household ID do not identify unique households. We grouped households based on a running sequence of individual ID after sorting the households by governorate, household ID and individual ID. Individuals in a sequence are classified into a single household for as long as a running number does not start back to 1. 

### Discrepancies between the questionnaire and variables in the raw datasets
While the Tunisia ENPE questionnaire remains largely unchanged over time, there were certain instances when the raw datasets do not contain the universe of variables implied by the questionnaire. These recurring variables are detailed [here](Variable_availability.md).

### Employment: Industry Classification
The Tunisia ENPE uses two-digit industry codes that do not align with the International Standards for Industrial Classification (ISIC). For this reason, we do not code `industrycat_isic`. The precise details are covered in a separate document [here](Industry.md)

### Employment: Occupation Classification
The Tunisia ENPE uses an occupational classification system equal to the International Standards of Classification for Occupation 1988 (ISCO-88) at the first two digits. However, the availability of occupation codes and their level of detail is not consistent over time. The precise details are covered in a separate document [here](Occupation.md)
