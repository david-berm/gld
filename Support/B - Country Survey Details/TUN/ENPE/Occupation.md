# Occupation Classification

The Tunisia ENPE uses an occupational classification system equal to the International Standards of Classification for Occupation 1988 (ISCO-88) at the first two digits. However, the availability of occupation codes is inconsistent over time. There are two years, in 2007 and 2008, where occupation codes are not available despite being asked in the questionnaire. The level of detail also varies as shown by the tabe below. In some years, only a single-digit occupation code is provided, in which case, we leave `occup_isco` as missing.
