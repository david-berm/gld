# Industry classification
In Tunisia, the ENPE surveys use the Nomenclature des Activit√©s Tunisiennes (NAT) to classify industries. Notably, the 2001 survey utilized the NAT at a three-digit level, providing a more detailed industry classifications. In contrast, all other survey years employed a standardized two-digit industry code system, which does not correspond directly to the initial digits of the NAT codes. Below, we provide a correspondence table between the three-digit NAT codes used in 2001, the standardized two-digit industry codes used in other years, and their mappings to the `industrycat10` classification system.
