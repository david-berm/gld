## What is the SLE LFS?

The 2014 SLE LFS is the first labor force survey in the country since 1984. Before SLE LFS 2014, the 2004 and 2011 country integrated household survey were the main source of information on labor market and employment. SLE LFS 2014 was conducted by the Statistics Sierra Leone (SSL), with the support of the World Bank, the International Labour Organization, and the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit. The survey data was collected between July and August 2014 and is nationally representative. 


## What does the SLE LFS cover?

The SLE LFS mainly covers detailed information on demographic details, including age, sex, marital status, and location, education, and labour market activities over the previous 7 days and in the past year. In addition, the SLE LFS also includes information on migration. As we currently only have one year survey data, there is no way to compare the depth and richness in information between years. However, SLE LFS covers 25,645 individuals, 4,199 households randomly selected from a stratified cluster sample with oversampling urban areas. At strata level, it covers 280 enumeration areas in 19 districts/cities plus Western region as a whole.    

Below is a table showing districts and cities in the report vs. in the data:

## Where can the data be found?

The Microdata is freely available on the public [World Bank microdata library](https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/2687). The data and relevant documents are available from the [SSL website](http://www.statistics.sl/index.php/what-we-offer/open-data-free-datasets.html). 

## What is the sampling procedure?

The survey uses a two-stage cluster sampling methodology on a stratified cluster sample with oversampling in urban areas for non-response. 280 enumeration areas are selected from four regions which contain 19 districts or cities plus Western region as a whole, with 15 households randomly selected in each for a total 4,200 (4,199 in the data eventually) households as planned. SSL conducted the sampling using the 2004 Population and Housing Census as the sampling frame. The sample size was calculated using the formula below:

![formula](utilities/sampling_formula.png)

(*NOTE: The target number of households in the sample, i.e. the sample size, was thus estimated at 4,200, based on the computed value of 4296 rounded down to 4200 for ease of use and due to budget constraints.*)

## What is the geographic significance level?

It is designed to be representative of district populations.

## Other noteworthy aspects  

### Addressing enumeration code duplication across districts/cities

In the raw dataset, 4 enumeration area (EA) codes replicated in other districts/cities. Or in other words, there are cases where one same EA code appears in different districts/cities. The four replicated EA codes are shown in the screenshot below:

![duplication](utilities/duplicated%20EA.png)

Considering the pairs of districts being duplicated are adjacent to each other, we reasonably suppose that some people living very near the border or with high mobility between the two adjoining area might be assigned to the neighbor district whereas they deem themselves living in the other district. Therefore, following this logic, we overwrote some districts, specifically the district with fewer observations compared with the other district that contain the same EA code.

| **EA Code**	| **Original District Name**	| **Changed to**	| **Cases Overwritten**	|
| :---------------:	| :---------------:		| :------------------:	 	| :--------------:	|
| 240203041 | 22. Kambia |  24. Port Loko | 6 |
| 320504031 | 31. Bo | 32. Bonthe | 7 |
| 420805102 | 41. Western Rural  | 42. Western Urban | 11 |
| 420806142 | 41. Western Rural  | 42. Western Urban | 6  |

### Missing Strata

Strata in SLE, instead of being district as most of the case in other countries, is part of the sampling design and more of the rural-urban/peri-urban divide. Furthermore, the stratum should be unique within a district or region in the case of SLE. However, the variable named "stratum" in the raw dataset, has overlapping stratum codes between regions and districts. Hence, we did not code strata.

### Household Weight - Two Different Weighting Variables

In a [separate datafile](utilities/Additional%20Data/weights.dta), the variable `wt_hh` has 280 unique values (the one we finally used for harmonization) whereas the original variable in the raw dataset has only 28. The weight with only 28 values may been somehow aggregated with a reason unknown to us. We used the `wt_hh` in the separate weight file by merging it to the main raw datafile at the beginning. The main reason is that using it yields a much closer estimate of working age population (WAP) compared to SLE's national report. Using the other will yield a far fewer estimate. In the national report, the WAP (aged 15 to 64) is **3,009,472**.

![WAP_report](utilities/reportWAP.png)

To compare, here are WAP of using 28-value and 280-value weights respectively. 

![28value](utilities/wap_weight28.png)

![280value](utilities/wap_weight280.png)

Though our final estimate of WAP is a bit higher than the report, it reflects objectively what the dataset provides, using the correct weight. And also note that these are results after applying an eligibility condition, which shall be explained in the next point. 

### Difference with ILO Data

The choice of weight variable also showed up in the quality checks, when comparing with ILO data. Below are the results from ILOSTAT:

![ILO_WAP](utilities/ILO.png)

The population aged 15 and above (and their labor status) is in line with the data if the “simplified” 28 values weights are used:

![28value_ineligible](utilities/wap_weight28_incl_ineligible.png)

If the more detailed weights are used (as in the GLD harmonization) the ratios stay roughly the same but the absolute numbers increase:

![280value_ineligibile](utilities/wap_weight280_incl_ineligible.png)

The GLD data is thus different to the ILO published data yet we believe it to be containing the correct information.

### Eligibility Variable

As the comments in the scripts explain, `A17_corrected` was created following the questionnaire's rules and it shows that 20.6% of the sample size are not eligible for the survey. These observations are in fact not interviewed, as they do not have values for variables after `A17`. The eligibility in `A17` is related to variable `A_16`. The SLE LFS required in 2014 that each individual spend 4 nights each week in the household over the previous four weeks in order to be thought of as a LFS eligible.

In the GLD harmonization all responses are kept. They can be used to calculate the total population and have responses to demographic variables (e.g., sex, age) but have missing values for the rest of the individual responses.

### Wage Analysis Against Age

Our single-year quality check result of SLE 2014 shows that the relationship between wage and age does not conform with general expectation: the income increases as age increases from young adult stage to senior stage before retiring; and income falls as age grows into retiring stage. 

![SLE_wage_analysis](utilities/SLE_wage_analysis.png)

A closer look at the data reveals that this is caused by a very small sample size (observations of 7) with above-average income. These observations' occupations, such as professors, or law-makers of professionals, do not follow the general rule of wage-age relationship. And their high average income pulls the wage of retirees up, which leads to the red flag of wage analysis.
