## What is the NPL LFS?

The 1998 NPL LFS is the first labor force survey in the country. The Ninth Five-Year Development Plan of Nepal prioritized poverty alleviation through employment generation and skills enhancement. The national LFS was initiated with the aim to better monitor the labour market and provide comprehensive statistics on employment, unemployment, and underemployment. The 1998 LFS was carried out by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) from 1998 to 1999, with technical assistance from the International Labour Organization and financial support from the United Nations Development Programme. 

## What does the NPL LFS cover?

The NPL LFS mainly covers detailed information on demographic details, including age, sex, marital status, and location, education, and labour market activities. This harmonization series has three years: 1998, 2008, and 2017. The first year, 1998 does not have migration section compared to the other two years. 1998 and 2008 both have two recall periods, 7-day and 12-month recall periods whereas 2017 only has 7-day recall period. In terms of geographical coverage, all three years cover the whole country, and the data are nationally representative. 

Below is a table showing each year's simple size with their official annual reports linked:

| **Year**	| **# of Households**	| **# of Individuals**	| **Expanded Population**	| **# of PSU**	| **Planned Sample Size(# HH)**	| **Planned # of PSU**	|
| :------:	| :-------:		| :-------:	 	| :-------:	 	| :-------:	| :-------:	| :-------:	|
| [1998](utilities/NPL_LFS_1998_report.pdf)  | 14,355 | 74,622  |  20,085,787  |  719  | 14,400 | 720 |
| [2008](utilities/NPL_LFS_2008_report.pdf)  | 15,976 | 76,208  |  24,075,099  |  799  | 15,976 | 799 |
| [2017](utilities/NPL_LFS_2017_report.pdf)  | 18,000 | 77,638  |  29,022,288  |  900  | 18,000 | 900 |

## Where can the data be found?

The NPL LFS data is not publicly available. All the data we used was downloaded from SARRAW via datalibweb using the command `datalibweb, country(NPL) year(2017) type(SARRAW) surveyid(NLFS) clear`. It requires team members request the data and SAR team to approve it to download the data. Hence, the data is only accessible among World Bank colleagues upon request.

## What is the sampling procedure?

For 1998 and 2008, the total number of households is divided evenly between rural and urban areas. During the selection, a two-stage stratified sampling procedure based on probability proportional to size (PPS) was applied in both years. In the first stage, wards (PSUs) were selected with PPS, where the number of households in the ward at the time of the census provided the measure of size. In the second stage, from all the households listed in the selected PSUs, 20 households were selected from each on a systematic sampling basis. 

The level of representativeness changed from four regions to seven provinces and hence the sample design in 2017 is different from the previous years in stratification and sample selection. During the sample selection, 2017 has the problem that too few PSUs with large number of households and most of the PSUs have small number of households. To address this issue, 2017 LFS used a stratification strategy which stratifies PSUs in each domain (province combined with rural/urban division) into three following the Lavallee-Hidiroglou (LH) algorithm. Details of this methodology are illustrated below and can be found on page 3 in the annual official LFS report linked above to 2017 in the table.

This stratification method jointly minimizes the total coefficient of variation and the sample size in the choice of stratum boundaries and in the determination of sampling rate per stratum. Further accounting for the possible discrepancy between the stratification variables (number of households) and the target variable (e.g., number of employed individuals), modified LH Algorithm is used for a thorough review of methods of stratifying skewed populations. Modified LH Algorithm used to identify stratum boundaries of the three strata. Stratum 1 and Stratum 2 are smaller than Stratum 3, and are called the “take some” strata. Stratum 3, comprising of “bigger” PSUs where big is defined in terms of number of households, is also called “take all” stratum. From all the strata, samples were drawn from probability proportional to size (PPS) except in the areas where all the PSUs were taken in the sample. Regarding the sampling from stratum 3, the "take all" criterion was followed in all the rural areas and urban areas of province 3 only.

## What is the geographic significance level?

In 1998 and 2008, the distribution of the total 75 districts is by five developing regions and three ecological belts. The five regions are: Eastern, Central, Western, Mid-western, and Far-western. And the three ecological belts are: mountain, hill, and terai. The distribution is shown in the table below. The geographic significance level of both years is region by rural and urban divisions. 

![districts_1998_2008](utilities/districts_distribution.png)

In 2017, the first level of administration changed to seven provinces and thus the geographic significance level of 2017 is the combination of province and rural/urban divisions, which generates fourteen domains.

## Other noteworthy aspects  

### Names of the Provinces 

In the official report of 2017, four out of seven provinces were named after numbers (i.e., Province 1, Province 2, Province 3 and Province 5) instead of their actual province names and so does the raw data set. By checking the populations and and districts they have, we confirmed their names as:

<br>
<ins>1) Province 1: Koshi</ins>
<br>
<ins>2) Province 2: Madhesh</ins>
<br>
<ins>3) Province 3: Bagmati</ins>
<br>
<ins>4) Province 4: Gandaki</ins>
<br>
<ins>5) Province 5: Lumbini</ins>
<br>
<ins>6) Province 6: Karnali</ins> 
<br>
<ins>7) Province 7: Sudurpashchim</ins>
<br>

### The Splits of Nawalparasi and Rukum 

Two districts in Nepal have experienced an administrative change during the harmonized years. Nawalparasi was divided into district Parasi and district Nawalpur in 2015. And now the district Parasi is in Gandaki province whereas district Nawalpur is in Lumbini province. Similarly, district Rukum was split into two districts in 2017. It was split into district Western Rukum located in Lumbini province and Eastern Rukum in Karnali province. Instead of using the new district names, the raw data of 2017 still uses the original district names Nawalparas and Rukum, which matches one district to two different provinces. To correct this mismatch, we re-coded these two districts by splitting the observations and assigning them to their new districts, based on their provinces. In this way we increased the total number of district from 75 to 77. 
 
Because these changes happened after 2008 and 2008 did not use province as its administrative level in the survey, we only recoded the two districts to match observations to their current province in 2017.      

### Change of the Employment Standard

1998 and 2008 follow the 13th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) whereas 2017 follows the ICLS 19. Therefore, production of goods for own use such as tailoring or making mats for the household, or collecting water or firewood, count as "work" in 1998 and 2008 only. Accordingly, people engaging in these jobs are considered *employed* only in 1998 and 2008.   

### Definition of Migrants

As shown below, questions **B09** and **B13** in the questionnaire of 2017 are directly related to whether a given respondent is a migrant or not. B09 and B13 correspond to original variables `birth_same` and `last_res` in the raw data set. But tabulating these two variables indicates that 11,922 observations whose last usual place of residence is in the same municipality were not born in the same place.  

![questionnaire_2017](utilities/questionnaire_migrant.png)
![tabulation_2017](utilities/migrant.png)

The annual report of 2017 states the defition of migrant as belows:

![definition_2017](utilities/migrant_def.png)

Therefore, according to this definition, observations whose birhtplaces are not current municipalities (or in other words, `birth_same` is equal to 2) should be regarded as migrants. In this way, the wrighted number of migrants matched the reported data as 10,510,000.
