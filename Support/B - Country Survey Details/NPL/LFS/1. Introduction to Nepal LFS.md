## What is the NPL LFS?

The 1998 NPL LFS is the first labor force survey in the country. The Ninth Five-Year Development Plan of Nepal prioritized poverty alleviation through employment generation and skills enhancement. The national LFS was initiated with the aim to better monitor labor market and provide comprehensive statistics on employment, unemployment, and underemployment. The 1998 LFS was carried out by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) from 1998 to 1999, with technical assistance from the International Labour Organization and financial support from the United Nations Development Programme. 

## What does the NPL LFS cover?

The NPL LFS mainly covers detailed information on demographic details, including age, sex, marital status, and location, education, and labour market activities. This harmonization series has three years: 1998, 2008, and 2017. The first year 1998 does not have migration section compared to the other two years. 1998 and 2008 both have two recall periods, 7-day and 12-month recall periods whereas 2017 only has 7-day recall period. In terms of geographical coverage, all three years cover the whole country and the data are nationally representative. 

Below is a table showing each year's simple size with their official annual reports linked:

| **Year**	| **# of Households**	| **# of Individuals**	| **Expanded Population**	| **# of PSU**	| **Planned Sample Size(# HH)**	| **Planned # of PSU**	|
| :------:	| :-------:		| :-------:	 	| :-------:	 	| :-------:	 	|
| [1998](utilities/NPL_LFS_1998_report.pdf)  | 14,355 | 74,622  |  20,085,787  |  719  | 14,400 | 720 |
| [2008](utilities/NPL_LFS_2008_report.pdf)  | 15,976 | 76,208  |  24,075,099  |  799  | 15,976 | 799 |

## Where can the data be found?

The Microdata is freely available on the public [World Bank microdata library](https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/2687). The data and relevant documents are available from the [SSL website](http://www.statistics.sl/index.php/what-we-offer/open-data-free-datasets.html). 

## What is the sampling procedure?

For 1998 and 2008, the total number of household is divided evenly between rural and urban areas. During the selection, a two-stage stratified sampling procedure based on probability proportional to size (PPS) was applied in both years. In the first stage, wards (PSUs) were selected with PPS, where the number of households in the ward at the time of the census provided the measure of size. In the second stage, from all the households listed in the selected PSUs, 20 households were selected from each on a systematic sampling basis. 

The level of representativeness changed from four regions to seven provinces and hence the sample design in 2017 is different from the previous years in stratification and sample selection. During the sample selection, 2017 has the probelm that too few PSUs with large number of households and most of the PSUs have small number of housoeholds. To address this issue, 2017 LFS used a stratification strategy which stratifies PSUs in each domain (province combined with rural/urban division) into three following the Lavallee-Hidiroglou (LH) algorithm. Details of this methodology is are illustrated below and can be found on page 3 in the annual official LFS report linked above to 2017 in the table.

This stratification method jointly minimizes the total coefficient of variation and the sample size in the choice of stratum boundaries and in the determination of sampling rate per stratum. Further accounting for the possible discrepancy between
the stratification variables (number of households) and the target variable (e.g., number of employed individuals), modified LH Algorithm is used for a thorough review of methods of stratifying skewed populations. Modified LH Algorithm used to identify stratum boundaries of the three strata. Stratum 1 and Stratum 2 are smaller than Stratum 3, and are called the “take some” strata. Stratum 3, comprising of “bigger” PSUs where big is defined in terms of number of households, is also called “take all” stratum. From all the strata, samples were drawn from probability proportional to size (PPS) except in the areas where all the PSUs were taken in the sample. Regarding the sampling from stratum 3, the "take all" criterion was followed in all the rural areas and urban areas of province 3 only.

## What is the geographic significance level?

It is designed to be representative of district populations.

## Other noteworthy aspects  

### Addressing enumeration code duplication across districts/cities

In the raw dataset, 4 enumeration area (EA) codes replicated in other districts/cities. Or in other words, there are cases where one same EA code appears in different districts/cities. The four replicated EA codes are shown in the screenshot below:

![duplication](utilities/duplicated%20EA.png)

Considering the pairs of districts being duplicated are adjacent to each other, we reasonably suppose that some people living very near the border or with high mobility between the two adjoining area might be assigned to the neighbor district whereas they deem themselves living in the other district. Therefore, following this logic, we overwrote some districts, specifically the district with fewer observations compared with the other district that contain the same EA code.

| **EA Code**	| **Original District Name**	| **Changed to**	| **Cases Overwritten**	|
| :---------------:	| :---------------:		| :------------------:	 	| :--------------:	|
| 240203041 | 22. Kambia |  24. Port Loko | 6 |
| 320504031 | 31. Bo | 32. Bonthe | 7 |
| 420805102 | 41. Western Rural  | 42. Western Urban | 11 |
| 420806142 | 41. Western Rural  | 42. Western Urban | 6  |

### Missing Strata

Strata in NPL, instead of being district as most of the case in other countries, is part of the sampling design and more of the rural-urban/peri-urban divide. Furthermore, the stratum should be unique within a district or region in the case of NPL. However, the variable named "stratum" in the raw dataset, has overlapping stratum codes between regions and districts. Hence, we did not code strata.

### Household Weight - Two Different Weighting Variables

In a [separate datafile](utilities/Additional%20Data/weights.dta), the variable `wt_hh` has 280 unique values (the one we finally used for harmonization) whereas the original variable in the raw dataset has only 28. The weight with only 28 values may been somehow aggregated with a reason unknown to us. We used the `wt_hh` in the separate weight file by merging it to the main raw datafile at the beginning. The main reason is that using it yields a much closer estimate of working age population (WAP) compared to NPL's national report. Using the other will yield a far fewer estimate. In the national report, the WAP (aged 15 to 64) is **3,009,472**.

![WAP_report](utilities/reportWAP.png)

To compare, here are WAP of using 28-value and 280-value weights respectively. 

![28value](utilities/wap_weight28.png)

![280value](utilities/wap_weight280.png)

Though our final estimate of WAP is a bit higher than the report, it reflects objectively what the dataset provides, using the correct weight. And also note that these are results after applying an eligibility condition, which shall be explained in the next point. 

### Difference with ILO Data

The choice of weight variable also showed up in the quality checks, when comparing with ILO data. Below are the results from ILOSTAT:

![ILO_WAP](utilities/ILO.png)

The population aged 15 and above (and their labor status) is in line with the data if the “simplified” 28 values weights are used:

![28value_ineligible](utilities/wap_weight28_incl_ineligible.png)

If the more detailed weights are used (as in the GLD harmonization) the ratios stay roughly the same but the absolute numbers increase:

![280value_ineligibile](utilities/wap_weight280_incl_ineligible.png)

The GLD data is thus different to the ILO published data yet we believe it to be containing the correct information.


### Wage Analysis Against Age

Our single-year quality check result of NPL 2014 shows that the relationship between wage and age does not conform with general expectation: the income increases as age increases from young adult stage to senior stage before retiring; and income falls as age grows into retiring stage.
