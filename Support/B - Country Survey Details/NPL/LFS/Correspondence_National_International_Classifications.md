# Correspondences between national and international classifications

This document describes the methodology used to map national industrial and occupational codes to their international counterparts. Two versions of the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) and International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) were used in NPL 1998, 2008, and 2017. Accordingly, there are two sets of national classifications that correspond to each version of international classification: *Nepal Standard Industrial Classification* (NSIC) and *Nepal Standard Classification of Occupation* (NSCO). But we do not have the specific number of the of NSIC's and NSCO's versions. The international version used in each year and their counterparts with links to their official documents are listed below. Please note that 1998 and 2008 use the same international and national classifications. Since we do not have the specific version name of NSIC and NSCO, NSIC and NSCO are named after the year in the table. 

| **Year**	| **ISIC** | **NSIC** | **ISCO** | **NSCO** |  
| :-------:	| :------: | :-------:| :-------:| :-------:| 
| [1998](utilities/2008_classification.pdf)  | ISIC Rev.3 | NSIC 1998 & 2008 | ISCO-88 | NSCO 1998 & 2008 | 
| [2008](utilities/2008_classification.pdf)  | ISIC Rev.3 | NSIC 1998 & 2008 | ISCO-88 | NSCO 1998 & 2008 | 
| [2017](utilities/2017_classification.pdf)  | ISIC Rev.4 | NSIC 2017 | ISCO-08 | NSCO 2017 | 


## Correspondence in industrial classification

**NSIC 1998 & 2008 VS.ISIC Rev.3**

The NSIC used in NPL 1998 and NPL 2008 is at two-digit level and matches ISIC Rev.3 except only one category â€“ *98 Extra-territorial organizations and bodies*.    

| **NSIC-1998 & 2008 Code**	| **KBLI-1997 Industry**	| **ISIC Rev.3 Code**	| **ISIC Rev.3 Industry**	|
| :-----------------------:	| :---------------------:	| :------------------:|:-----------------------:|	 	
| 98 | Extra-territorial organizations and bodies | 99 | Extra-territorial organizations and bodies |

**NSIC 2017 VS.ISIC Rev.3**

The NSIC used in NPL 2017 is at two-digit level and is identical to ISIC Rev.3, so there is no revision to NSIC 2017.

## Correspondence in the classification of occupations

**NSCO 1998 & 2008 VS.ISCO 88**

The NSCO used in NPL 1998 and 2008 is at three-digit level. It has four categories that need to be re-mapped to ISCO-88.

| **NSCO-1998 & 2008 Code**	| **NSCO-1998 & 2008 Occupation**	| **ISCO 88 Code**	| **ISCO 88 Occupation**	|
| :-----------------------:	| :-----------------------------:	| :----------------:|:-----------------------:|	 	
| 745 | Carpet makers and weavers | 740 | Other craft and related trades workers |
| 746 | Tailors, dressmakers and hatters | 743 | Textile, garment and related trades workers |
| 922 | Fetching water | 920 | Agricultural, fishery and related labourers |
| 934 | Collecting firewood | 920 | Agricultural, fishery and related labourers |
