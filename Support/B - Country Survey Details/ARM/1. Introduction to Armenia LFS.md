## What is the ARM LFS?

The Armenian Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a household-based sample survey conducted by the National Statistical Service (NSS) of the Republic of Armenia. Before 2014, the Households Integrated Living Condition Survey played the central role of providing labour market statistics. Since 2014, the ARM LFS was conducted monthly every year with the aim to measure the levels and trends of employment, unemployment and labour force in Armenia. 


## What does the ARM LFS cover?

The ARM LFS findings provide annual and quarterly short-term labour market statistical indicators. In addition to general household characteristics, the LFS covers indicators such as the country labour resources, or working age population (aged 15 to 75), by gender, age, education and family statues; active and inactive population in labour market by various characteristics; employment in different economic sectors, working hours and incomes etc. The ARM LFS started to include migration information since 2018. 

**Scope of Survey**:
<br>
1) Primary Sampling Unit (PSU): PSU is a private household. The residents of the retirement homes, prisons
and other institutional households are not surveyed.
2) Survey Units: People aged from 15 to 75 who a) usually live in a given household; b) were absent from the household up to 12 months (in country or abroad); c) were in compulsory military service.
3) Observation Period: All 12 months of the surveyed year.
4) Reference Period: The last one calendar week preceding the survey, from Monday to Sunday.
5) Geographical Coverage: Survey conducted in all 11 marzes (provinces), covering both rural and urban settlements.

GLD harmonization of ARM LFS covers years from 2014 to 2022 continuously, 9 years in total. Years and their corresponding sample sizes of LFS harmonized are:

| **Year**	| **# of Households**	| **# of Individuals**	| **Expanded Population**	| **Officially Reported Sample Size(# HH)**	| 
| :------:	| :-------:		| :-------:	 	| :-------:	 	| :-------:	|

(*Note: The officially reported sample sizes are from methodology documentation of each year, which can be found from the [online publication library of NSS](https://armstat.am/en/?nid=82&year=2013).*)  

## Where can the data be found?
All data is publicly available on the website of [Statistical Committee of the Republic of Armenia] ([http://nada.nso.gov.lk/index.php/home](https://armstat.am/en/?nid=212)). As mentioned above, each year's corresponding documentation on employment and other estimates can be downloaded without any restrictions from their oneline publication library.

## What is the sampling procedure?

A two stage stratified sample by regions (marzes) has been designed to conduct the survey. The method of systematic probability sampling was used to frame the sample. Yerevan and all marzes with rural and urban settlements were covered by sample population with proportion of all households available in these strata. Based on the administrative and territorial division of ARM at the first stage of sampling, the preliminary sampling units, i.e. enumeration areas were selected. At the second stage of sampling, the PSU or households, were randomly selected.  

## What is the geographic significance level?

The ARM LFS is representative at the urban/rural division of each marze level. 

## Other noteworthy aspects  

### Changes in International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) version and its impact on results  

The ARM LFS went through a change between 2017 and 2018 in its questionnaire structure and the ICLS version applied which accordingly changed some of the questions surveyed. From 2014 to 2017, the ARM LFS used ICLS-13, meaning that working for own consumption is defined as employed. The change in the definition is rdocumented in the methodology section of [2017](utilities/ARM_2014-2017_employment_definition.pdf) and [2018](utilities/ARM_2018_employment_definition.pdf)'s annual reports. The table below shows the difference in the official explanations and employment block in 2017 and 2018's questionnaires.

### Coding of industry and occupation codes

In terms of classifications of industry and occupation, we only have definite information on the national and international versions used for years from 2013 to 2021. As mentioned in the previous section, these years use national classifications SLSCO-08 and SLSIC 4 which are based on ISCO-08 and ISIC rev.4 respectively. For years before 2013, 2002 and 2012 annual reports both claim to use ISCO-88 and ISIC rev.4. However, we were unable to validate this claim and even if we had confirmed it we would not have the corresponding table to map. The original industrial and occupation variables in the raw data sets not only have categories beyond ISIC and ISCO, but also miss a whole industrial group such as "Manufacture of wearing apparel". 

For 2013-2021, we harmonized both industry and occupation at 4-digit level. Detailed corresponding tables and mapping process are in this [separate document](Correspondence_National_International_Classifications.md) .
