## What is the ARM LFS?

The Armenian Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a household-based sample survey conducted by the National Statistical Service (NSS) of the Republic of Armenia. Before 2014, the Households Integrated Living Condition Survey played the central role of providing labour market statistics. Since 2014, the ARM LFS was conducted monthly every year with the aim to measure the levels and trends of employment, unemployment and labour force in Armenia. 


## What does the ARM LFS cover?

The ARM LFS findings provide annual and quarterly short-term labour market statistical indicators. In addition to general household characteristics, the LFS covers indicators such as the country labour resources, or working age population (aged 15 to 75), by gender, age, education and family statues; active and inactive population in labour market by various characteristics; employment in different economic sectors, working hours and incomes etc. The ARM LFS started to include migration information since 2018. 

**Scope of Survey**:
<br>
1) Primary Sampling Unit (PSU): PSU is a private household. The residents of the retirement homes, prisons
and other institutional households are not surveyed.
2) Survey Units: People aged from 15 to 75 who a) usually live in a given household; b) were absent from the household up to 12 months (in country or abroad); c) were in compulsory military service.
3) Observation Period: All 12 months of the surveyed year.
4) Reference Period: The last one calendar week preceding the survey, from Monday to Sunday.
5) Geographical Coverage: Survey conducted in all 11 marzes (provinces), covering both rural and urban settlements.

GLD harmonization of ARM LFS covers years from 2014 to 2022 continuously, 9 years in total. Years and their corresponding sample sizes of LFS harmonized are:

| **Year**	| **# of Households**	| **# of Individuals**	| **Expanded Population**	| **Officially Reported Sample Size(# HH)**	|

(*Note: The officially reported sample sizes are from methodology documentation of each year, which can be found from the [online publication library of NSS](https://armstat.am/en/?nid=82&year=2013).*)  

## Where can the data be found?
All data is publicly available on the website of [Statistical Committee of the Republic of Armenia] ([http://nada.nso.gov.lk/index.php/home](https://armstat.am/en/?nid=212)). As mentioned above, each year's corresponding documentation on employment and other estimates can be downloaded without any restrictions from their oneline publication library.

## What is the sampling procedure?

A two stage stratified sample by regions (marzes) has been designed to conduct the survey. The method of systematic probability sampling was used to frame the sample. Yerevan and all marzes with rural and urban settlements were covered by sample population with proportion of all households available in these strata. Based on the administrative and territorial division of ARM at the first stage of sampling, the preliminary sampling units, i.e. enumeration areas were selected. At the second stage of sampling, the PSU or households, were randomly selected.  

## What is the geographic significance level?

The LKA LFS is representative at the urban/rural division of each district level. 

Note that in the raw data the `sector` variable originally has three categories: urban, rural, and estate. An estate sector in Sri Lanka is actually a plantation sector. An estate sector consists of all plantations which are 20 acres or more
in extent and ten or more resident labourers. All areas other than urban and estate comprise the rural sector [(_Sinnathurai, V., Březinová, O., 2012_)](utilities/Sinnathurai_V_Březinová_O_2012.pdf). We classified estate as rural in our harmonization, considering the level of poverty, development, population and housing factors. However, coding urban/rural status in this way resulted a much higher proportion of urban population that is as twice as the numbers in ILO and World Bank Development Indicators (WDI) in 1992-1995 (i.e., 39% in our harmonized data versus 18% in other sources). However, the urbanization rate in our harmonized data drops from 39.04% in 1995 to 14.37% in 1996 and then fluctuates around 16.5% in later years, regardless that we use our urban-rural coding scheme consistently in all years. Additionally, the urbanization statistics in LKA national annual reports range from 21.62% in 1994 to 17.12% in 2021. It is even lower in some years' quarterly report, 16.12% in the fourth quarter of 1999 for example. This mismatch seems to be caused by the ill-defined urban-rural definition. More discussion of urban-rural definition of LKA in the next section "Other noteworthy aspects - Urban/rural definition".        


## Other noteworthy aspects  

### Changes in ICLS version and the impact on results  


### Coding of industry and occupation codes

In terms of classifications of industry and occupation, we only have definite information on the national and international versions used for years from 2013 to 2021. As mentioned in the previous section, these years use national classifications SLSCO-08 and SLSIC 4 which are based on ISCO-08 and ISIC rev.4 respectively. For years before 2013, 2002 and 2012 annual reports both claim to use ISCO-88 and ISIC rev.4. However, we were unable to validate this claim and even if we had confirmed it we would not have the corresponding table to map. The original industrial and occupation variables in the raw data sets not only have categories beyond ISIC and ISCO, but also miss a whole industrial group such as "Manufacture of wearing apparel". 

For 2013-2021, we harmonized both industry and occupation at 4-digit level. Detailed corresponding tables and mapping process are in this [separate document](Correspondence_National_International_Classifications.md) . 


### Migrated from other countries



### Age variables in 2021 and 2022



### Educational categories


### Employment rate comparison

In addition to GLD routine quality checks, we also cross checked with each year's annual report to tap into the rich and comprehensive statistics provided in most of the years. The complete comparison results are in this [excel workbook](utilities/LKA_employment_stats_comparison.xlsx). Below only shows the labour force participation rate comparison, which indicates the closeness of our harmonized results and the official estimates.
