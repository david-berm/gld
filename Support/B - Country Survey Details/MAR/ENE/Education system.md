# Morocco's education system

Morocco's education system is structured into several distinct levels, each with its own set of requirements and duration. The system begins with the optional pre-primary education followed by nine years of compulsory basic education, starting from age 6. This basic education is divided into two cycles: six years of primary education and three years of lower secondary education. After completing lower secondary education, students have the option to pursue either general/technical secondary education or vocational training. The general/technical secondary education lasts for three years and culminates in the baccalauréat exam, which is crucial for entry into higher education. For vocational training, students can enter a variety of programs post-lower secondary education, depending on their qualifications and the entrance examinations they pass.

The Morocco ENE uses a 4-digit classification system to identify respondents' educational attainment called the *Nomenclature nationale des diplômes*. In the raw datasets, the variable for this detailed education codes was available between the 2000 and 2013 rounds, which used the June 2000 version. In the succeeding years, the datasets we received did not include the 4-digit education codes, but instead have broad education categories.


The mapping between the GLD `educat7` categories and the education codes in the 2000 *Nomenclature* are detailed below:


The mapping between the GLD `educat7` categories and the broad education categories used in the 2014-2018 rounds are shown in the table below:






The implication of this switch from a detailed to a broad classification system is the inability to determine "secondary incomplete". As shown in the chart below, "secondary incomplete" is absorbed by the category "primary complete" in the rounds 2014 onwards. For consistency in the breakdown, users are advised to use `educat5` or `educat4`
