# Mapping the Morocco Occupation Codes to ISCO 2008

The Morocco EnquÃªte Nationale sur l'Emploi (ENE) uses a national system of occupation classification called the "Nomenclature Analyique des Professions" that is distinct from the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) versions. In many cases, national occupational codes retain ISCO occupation codes at the two-digit level, with revisions done in the succeeding digits to represent specific occupations in the country. In the case of Morocco ENE, not even the first digit of the national occupation codes align seamlessly with that of ISCO 2008, or any of its previous versions. Consequently, we have undertaken the task of mapping the two-digit occupational codes between Morocco's system and ISCO 2008, as detailed in the table below:

| Original Code | Translated Description                                                                                                       | ISCO'08 Code | ISCO'08 Description                                         |
