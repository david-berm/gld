# Introduction to the Morocco Enquête Nationale sur l’Emploi (ENE)

## What is the MAR ENE?

The Morocco Enquête Nationale sur l’Emploi (ENE) is a labor force survey conducted by the La Direction de la Statistique relevant du Haut Commissariat au Plan (The Statistics Unit of the High Commission for Planning of Morocco). The survey began in 1976 as an annual survey with an exclusively urban sample. It evolved to become a nationally representative survey in 1999, and began collecting quarterly information in 1996. While the survey goes a long way, the GLD only has data for each year between 2000 and 2018.  

The table below summarizes the evolution of the survey design over time: 
|                         | 1976-1982                       | 1984-1993                                | 1995-2005                                                                                           | 2006-2016                                                                                     | 2017-present                                                                            |

## What does the MAR ENE cover?

The Morocco ENE mainly covers information on the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, education and labor market activites over the past 7 days. 

While the survey started in 1976, the GLD only has data for each year between 2000 and 2018. Note that with changes in sampling frame, household sample size expanded in years 2006 (from ~45000 to ~60000) and 2017 (from ~60000 to ~90000). Sample size for each survey round are as follows:

| Year | Persons  | Households |
|------|----------|------------|
| 2000 | 225,644  | 40,980     |
| 2001 | 216,672  | 40,279     |
| 2002 | 206,755  | 39,368     |
| 2003 | 234,100  | 45,116     |
| 2004 | 226,433  | 44,288     |
| 2005 | 230,832  | 45,673     |
| 2006 | 284,733  | 60,111     |
| 2007 | 277,193  | 59,431     |
| 2008 | 266,789  | 58,114     |
| 2009 | 263,068  | 58,601     |

| 2011 | 251,955  | 58,023     |
| 2012 | 245,805  | 57,636     |
| 2013 | 244,759  | 57,806     |
| 2014 | 240,024  | 57,325     |
| 2015 | 235,948  | 57,209     |
| 2016 | 230,667  | 57,284     |
| 2017 | 359,971  | 88,562     |
| 2018 | 345,647  | 86,380     |

## Where can the data be found?

The datasets are not accessible to the public and researchers have to request the data from the Haut Commissariat au Plan. The World Bank has been granted access to the datasets, if you work or are part of the World Bank Group, kindly contact the Jobs Group with a formal request for access to gld@worldbank.org

## What is the sampling procedure?

The survey adopts a two stage stratified sampling design. The national territory is initially segmented into drawing zones based on homogeneity. Within these zones, Primary Sampling Units (PSUs), each comprising several adjacent census districts, are defined. The master sample is formed by selecting a certain percentage of these PSUs, ensuring balanced representation across different areas. PSUs are chosen within each zone by probability proportional to size.

## What is the significance level?

The official reports detail results by area of residence (urban/rural) and regions. 

## Other Noteworthy Aspects

### Geographic information

Morocco underwent a comprehensive reorganization of its regional boundaries in 2015. For more information on the regional reorganization and its implications on the survey data, refer to this [separate document](Geographic%20Information.md).

### Education

The Morocco ENE uses a 4-digit classification system to identify respondents' educational attainment called the *Nomenclature nationale des diplômes* (NND). In the raw datasets, detailed education codes based on the [NND 2000](Utilities/Nomenclature%20nationale%20des%20diplômes,%20Juin%202000%20(Version%20Fr.pdf) were available between the 2000 and 2013 rounds, but switched to broad categories in succeeding rounds. For more details on Morocco's education system and the mapping with the GLD `educat7` categories, refer to this [separate document](Education%20system.md).

### Occupation codes

The Morocco ENE uses the 4-digit *Nomenclature Analytique des Professions* (NAP) to classify occupations. In the 2000 - 2009 rounds, the occupation information were detailed at the 4-digit level following the NAP 2001. In the case of the 2000 ENE, the occupation codes appear to be identical to [NAP 2001](Utilities/Nomenclature%20analytique%20des%20professions,%20Mai%202001%20(Version%20Fr).pdf) despite being released one year prior. In the 2010 - 2017 rounds, only aggregated occupation information are available; and in 2018, the occupation information were based on [NAP 2014](Utilities/Nomenclature%20analytique%20des%20professions,%20Décembre%202014%20(Version%20Fr)%20(1).pdf). Both the NAP 2001 and NAP 2014 are not compatible with the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO). For this reason, along with the aggregated occupation information in the other years, we skipped on constructing the detailed occupation variable, `occup_isco` for all years. However, we have prepared a recommended mapping at the 2-digit level using our best judgment as detailed in this [separate document](Mapping%20to%20ISCO.md). 

| ENE rounds   | Raw variable     | NAP version | ISCO equivalent      | 
|--------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|
| 2000 - 2009  | 4 digit codes    | NAP 2001    |Not compatible |
| 2010 - 2017  | 12 broad categories | Cannot be determined   | Not applicable           |
|  2018        | 4 digit codes    | NMA 2014    | Not compatible         |

### Industry codes
The Morocco ENE uses the *Nomenclature Morocaine des Activités* (NMA) to classify industries. In the 2000 - 2009 rounds, the industry information were detailed at the 4-digt level following the [NMA 1999](Utilities/Nomenclature%20marocaine%20des%20activités.pdf), which is compatible with ISIC rev 3 at the two-digit level. In the 2010 - 2017 rounds, only aggregated industry information are available and thus, we cannot construct `industrycat_isic`; and in 2018, the industry information were based on the [NMA 2010](Utilities/Nomenclature%20marocaine%20des%20activités,%20NMA%202010%20(version%20française).pdf), which is compatible with ISIC rev 4 at the two-digit level. 
| ENE rounds   | Raw variable     | NMA version | ISIC digits      | ISIC version |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| 2000 - 2009  | 4 digit codes    | NMA 1999    | First two digits | ISIC 3       |
| 2010 - 2017  | 16 broad categories | Cannot be determined   | Not applicable           | Not applicable       |
|  2018        | 4 digit codes    | NMA 2010    | First two digits           | ISIC 4       |
