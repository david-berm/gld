# Geographic Information on Morocco's Regional Reorganization in 2015

In 2015, Morocco underwent a comprehensive reorganization of its regional boundaries, changing from 16 to 12 regions. This reorganization was not a mere adjustment of a few regions but a complete overhaul, affecting the entire country with the exception of the Ed Dakhla-Oued ed Dahab region, which retained its original provincial composition. This significant change was proposed by the Commission consultative de la régionalisation in 2010, aiming to foster decentralization and enhance regional autonomy across Morocco.

## Understanding the Changes

The reorganization had profound implications for geographic and administrative divisions within the country:

- **Complete Overhaul vs. Partial Adjustments:** Unlike regional changes in other countries that might involve only a few regions, Morocco's approach was holistic, affecting all regions with substantial restructuring.
  
- **Implications for Labor Force Data:** For researchers, policymakers, and anyone utilizing Morocco's labor force data, it is crucial to note that region codes have been altered. A region labeled as "Region 1" prior to the reorganization may not correspond to the same geographic area in the new system. This change is pivotal when analyzing data or trends over time, ensuring accurate interpretations of regional dynamics.

- **2015 Labor Force Survey Data:** These administrative changes are reflected in the labor force survey data starting from 2015. It is essential for data users to reference the new regional classifications to obtain accurate and relevant insights.

Below is a summary table of the new regions, highlighting their source regions or provinces and the specific changes made:
